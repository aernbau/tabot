# TABot
  
This is a Taimanin Asagi Kessen Arena bot.  
It will only pick up actions for events, not regular actions.  
It can be pretty buggy as it tries to bypass some events within the game.  

## How to use

Import the file into Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey and (reload the game website and) run the game.  

## Currently:
・Can do the PvP event.  
・Can do the event of clicking and bosses.  
・Will refresh every 10 seconds to check health.  

## Future work:
・Implement the raidmap (half done).  
・Automatic card selling when inventory is full.  

## Removed:
・PvP battle skipping. Too imprecise.

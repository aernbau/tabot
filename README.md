# TABot

This is a Taimanin Asagi Kessen Arena bot.
It will only pick up actions for events, not regular actions.
It can be pretty buggy as it tries to bypass some events within the game.

## How to use

Import the file into Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey and it run the game.

## Currently:
・Can do the PvP event.  
・Skips battle animations.  
・Will refresh every 10 seconds to check health.  

## Future work:
・Implement the raidmap (half done) and clicker (0%) events.  
・Fully skipping the battle animations (they have a chance to still show up).  
・Automatic card selling when inventory is full.
